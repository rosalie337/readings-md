# Reading-01
## Monday, 10-28-2020

The ability to read and apply documentation is a core skill for developers. Thereâ€™s always new technologies to learn, and I understand that I need to learn them by reading the documentation and then playing around with code samples.

It think it can be extremely confusing if the documentation is not correct or updated. It seems like this book is older, but the information is still very useful despite it being older.
