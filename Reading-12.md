**The <canvas> element**

At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. The <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting. The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images using a grid or coordinate space.
