When I was first introduced to HTML, I learned primarily by copying and deleting parts of templates to see what their function served in the structure of the pages. Sometimes I would merely play with code to see how they would function or if they would function within varying tags. It's helpful to learn that these tags aren't just arbitrary letters and have meaning. The different ways to list items and nest were intuitive. I'm glad there was a chapter on boxes, or particularly how their appearance can shape the whole layout of our pages. I missed the boat the first week of when we worked on the name-tag. I am happy to have these books as reference tools moving forward.

As for the Chapter on Decisions and Loops. I am going to read it over again for good measure, it was making sense and then felt lost again.
