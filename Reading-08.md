**HTML5 set out to solve**: to provide a standardized API, implemented natively and consistently in multiple browsers, without having to rely on third-party plugins.

**HTML5 Storage**: A way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server

- Certain browser vendors also refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage.”

- From our JavaScript code, we can access HTML5 Storage through the localStorage object on the global window object.
