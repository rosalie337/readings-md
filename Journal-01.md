I was a little weary of starting all over again from foundations, but I am glad I made the decision to come back. I really underestimated how much I could forget while not actively coding over the last few months. It’s been great to get back at it. I really enjoyed the energy of the previous cohort I joined and it was nice to see familiar faces. Moreover, some of my favorite folks became TAs. 

It’s amazing to see how the structure of the program has improved. Alchemy really switched and made some great adaptations to the curriculum that will serve the students well. I feel like I am learning so much more in the format and the curriculum is better organized. I am not sure if it’s my confidence or the people, the energy feels different than before.

*Today, I am most proud of finishing my lab with passing tests*

<em>I believe I was able to achieve this by:</em>


- Working within a collaborative group of folks who want to help and I could lend help to
- Taking regular breaks
- Working in a quiet place
- Eating breakfast prior to lecture
- Positive self talk
- Reading console errors > Asking for help from peers > Using the TA rooms
- The environnement: working at home with people whom respect boundaries and respect that I am in school 

<em>I think I can improve by:</em>

- Getting proper sleep
- Revisiting recorded lectures
- Actively taking notes
- Uploading proper attachments
- Submitting the assignments immediately instead of last minute
- Reviewing the notes prior to lecture
- Prepare questions to ask during lab/lecture

I am a little anxious to return to Oregon this Thursday because it could change my working environment drastically. I feel like a lot of my success thus far has been because I am in Maryland.
